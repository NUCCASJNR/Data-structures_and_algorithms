Sure! Here's the Python equivalent of the C question:

Write a function in Python that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.

The function should have the following prototype:

python
Copy code
def binary_tree_insert_left(parent: Optional['BinaryTreeNode'], value: int) -> Optional['BinaryTreeNode']:
where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in, value is the value to store in the new node.

The function must return a pointer to the created node, or None on failure or if parent is None. If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.
